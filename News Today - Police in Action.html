	<h2>Police had to act</h2>
	<div align="center">
		<article class="light-text">2 Days ago, police, thanks to the intel, started their operation in order to finaly catch very slippery drug dealers notorious for selling drugs to children. They have been esceaping justice for far too long, but finaly, they made an error in judgment, left their guard down and thanks to that, police have been able to act. The whole operation was executed very quckly, almost no one was able to react in time, but we have aquired at least one photo (soory for the bad quality) and mp3 file of the police car in action.</article>

		<article class="light-text">Drug dealers have been arested and our children are little bit more safe on the streets. Hopefully it will discourage others from similar behavior in the future. And if not, we belive police will take care of them just as they take care of these criminals 2 days ago. We thank our police for their valiant efforts and hope for them to keep up the good work.</article>
