		<h3>Fake news</h3>
		<p class="light-text">Today's article is about fake news and how to make sure, you don't fall into the rabit hole. The thing is, today, anyone can say anything, especialy on the internet, where people can be bit more anonymus. So, what to do in order not to fall there? It's quite simple, all you have to do, is not to trust your instinct. When we hear something for the first time, we have a tendency to belive the information. So we would recommend to check on more websites, videos, ask your friends, just try to get a bigger picture. Once you have a bigger picture, you can judge from there, you choose the things to belive. To be honest, everyone can say a lie, wether they are aware or not, no one will say the complete truth, so you can't be 100% sure, that you don't get fake news, but it's more risky to just blindly accept, think about what you hear. Thats it for today.</p>
