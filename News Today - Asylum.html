		<article class="light-text" >We are very sorry to inform you, that a very dangerous person, that last week escaped from Asylum (psychiatric hospital) still roams free without a trace, police has no idea, how fast or if she travels alone. If she has some outside help, that could be very dangerous, anyone who will see someone resembling or someone helping (driving in a car, walking together, etc...). Miss Amanda is 27 years old, stands around 5 foot and 1 inch and has blonde hair. She might seem harmless at a first glance, but don't be fooled, she is very dangerous individual. At her arest it was suggested, she has multiple personality disorder and has taste for a human flesh. Police told us, she is a very good actor, doesn't have fully developed emotions, her moral principles are nonexistent and is very smart. She might very well fool you, if you are not careful, we wouldn't be suprised, if she's changed her hair color by now.</article>
